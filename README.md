# StructureFromMotion

*Structure from Motion* is one component of my Robotics and Computer Vision final project. The main objective was to construct a 3D point cloud of an object using several images taken from a cellphone camera. In my case, I used an iPhone6S to take pictures of a Rutgers Campus building, and then use tools such as OpenMVG, MATLAB, and geometric techniques learned in class to develop the point clouds. Feel free to have a look around, and don't hesitate to contact me with any questions! ProjectReport.pdf contains all of the methods and results.
